This is an implementation of the observer pattern.  It uses function
decorators to achieve the desired event registration mechanism.

# Function decorator approach
class event(object):
    '''
    This class serves as a utility to decorate a function as an event.

    The following example demonstrates its functionality in an abstract way.
    A class method can be decorated as follows:

    >>> class A(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...
    ...     @event
    ...     def progress(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    ...     def do_something(self):
    ...         print "Doing something..."
    ...         self.progress()

    A.progress is the event.  It is triggered within the method A.do_something.
    Now that we have a class with some event, let's create an event handler.

    >>> def handler(self):
    ...     print "Hello %s!" % self.name

    This handler only greets the object that triggered the event by using its
    name attribute.  Let's create some instances of A and register our new
    event handler to their progress event.

    >>> a = A("Foo")
    >>> b = A("Bar")
    >>> a.progress += handler
    >>> b.progress += handler

    Now everything has been setup.  When we call the method, the event will be
    triggered:

    >>> a.do_something()
    Doing something...
    Hello Foo!
    >>> b.do_something()
    Doing something...
    Hello Bar!
