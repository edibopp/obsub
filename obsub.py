This is an implementation of the observer pattern.  It uses function
decorators to achieve the desired event registration mechanism.

The idea is based on this thread:

class event(object):
    '''
    This class serves as a utility to decorate a function as an event.

    The following example demonstrates its functionality in an abstract way.
    A class method can be decorated as follows:

    >>> class A(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...
    ...     @event
    ...     def progress(self, first, second):
    ...         print("Doing something...")

    A.progress is the event.  It is triggered after executing the code in the
    decorated progress routine.

    Now that we have a class with some event, let's create an event handler.

    >>> def handler(self, first, second):
    ...     print("%s %s and %s!" % (first, self.name, second))

    Note that the handler (and signal calls) must have the signature defined
    by the decorated event method.

    This handler only greets the object that triggered the event by using its
    name attribute.  Let's create some instances of A and register our new
    event handler to their progress event.

    >>> a = A("Foo")
    >>> b = A("Bar")
    >>> a.progress.connect(partial(handler, a))
    >>> b.progress.connect(partial(handler, b))

    Now everything has been setup.  When we call the method, the event will be
    triggered:

    >>> a.progress("Hello", "World")
    Doing something...
    Hello Foo and World!
    >>> b.progress(second="Others", first="Hi")
    Doing something...
    Hi Bar and Others!

    What happens if we disobey the call signature?

    >>> c = A("World")
    >>> c.progress(second="World")  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: progress() missing 1 required positional argument: 'first'

    Class based access is possible as well:

    >>> A.progress(a, "Hello", "Y")
    Doing something...
    Hello Foo and Y!

    Bound methods keep the instance alive:

    >>> f = a.progress
    >>> import weakref, gc
    >>> wr = weakref.ref(a)
    >>> del a
    >>> c=gc.collect()
    >>> assert wr() is not None
    >>> f("Hi", "Z")
    Doing something...
    Hi Foo and Z!

    If we delete the hard reference to the bound method and run the garbage
    collector (to make sure it is run at all), the object will be gone:

    >>> del f
    >>> c=gc.collect()
    >>> assert wr() is None

def signal(function, event_handlers=None, _decorate=True):

    Signals are objects are primitive event emitter objects.

    * function -- templace function (will be executed before event handlers)
    * event_handlers -- event handler list object to use
    * _decorate -- whether to return a nicely decorated function object

    Calling a signal emits the event, i.e. all registered event handlers are
    called with the given arguments. Before the event handlers are called,
    the base function gets a chance to execute.

    You can use `signal` as a decorator, for example:

    >>> @signal
    ... def sig(foo="bar"):
    ...     """I'm a docstring!"""
    ...     print('In sig!')
    ...     return 'Return value.'

    >>> def handler(foo):
    ...     print("foo=%s" % foo)
    >>> sig.connect(handler)

    >>> sig()
    In sig!
    foo=bar
    'Return value.'

    >>> sig("hello")
    In sig!
    foo=hello
    'Return value.'
